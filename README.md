# Introduction

capitalETH aims to solve a major problem in Decentralized Finance - Investing.
capitalETH helps you invest systematically and in a disciplined way so you can sit tight and invest right!<br>

## What is capitalETH?

capitalETH is a smart and hassle-free way of investing in cryptocurrencies just like a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) in traditional finance. A capitalETH SIP is a planned approach towards investments and helps you build the habit of saving and building a portfolio for future.

Using capitalETH, you can invest a pre-determined amount at regular intervals. Investing small amounts regularly in the market averages out the buy price during highs and lows and reduces the risk significantly.<br>

## Why capitalETH?

Investing in decentralized cryptocurrencies has largely been ignored in the DeFi space. There are many people who are interested to be a part of this DeFi revolution and want to hold a stake in the ecosystem. New and less experienced people are often very confused about where to invest and most importantly when to invest. Volatility is very high in crypto markets and people are very skeptical about the best time to invest and in turn miss opportunities trying to time the entry. Majority of the people still invest based on anonymour tips and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO).<br>
